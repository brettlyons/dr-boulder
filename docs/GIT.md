### Getting Git working

#### Linux
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
# This should print git commands
git --help
```

### Mac

You probably already have it installed
Try running `git --help` to check
If it's not installed, choose one of the 2 options below:
- https://desktop.github.com/
- https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#mac-os-x

### Windows

- For a beginner I would recommend downloading [github for windows](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Once you have that installed, you should see a program called `Git Shell`. Use this instead of Command Line or Powershell
